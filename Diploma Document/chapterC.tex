\section{Tools}
	\subsection{Figma}
	Figma is the main tool of the UX/UI designer. On this service we have developed the design of our website. In figma we can:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Develop the interface and prototype of the site
		\item Save files to the cloud
		\item Integrate with different design applications
		\item Several people can enter and edit at the same time
	\end{itemize}
\section{UX}
In design, it is very important that the structure is created according to logic and all the rules of design. No matter how beautiful the site would be, if the structure is created incorrectly, the site will be non-working.

\section{Pages}
	\subsection{Main page}
		\subsubsection{Header}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Our logo is located on the upper left side.
			\item "About us", "Contact", "Log in" will be located on the upper right side
		\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Onboarding}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Also on the main page there is a brief information about the game, this is done so that when a person first visits the site, he understands where he got to.
		\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Starting game}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In the middle there will be 2 main buttons "Start game", "Join the game".
			\item "Start game". The emphasis is on the "Start game" button by coloring the button with a bright color. The emphasis was on this button in order to encourage more users to register in the game, since when you click on the "Start game" button, if a person is not registered, a registration window will pop up for him. And if a person is registered, then when you click on this button, he can immediately start playin.
			\item Join the game". This button is designed to allow players to join the creator's game. Clicking on this button will pop up a window with an input where players could enter the id of the game they want to join.
		\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Footer}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Footer will contain links to social networks in the form of icons
		\end{itemize}
